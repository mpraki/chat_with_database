It is an enterprise solution for managing direct debit agreements and batch validations. The schema is designed for Microsoft SQL Server and uses the `padd` schema for all tables.

**Core Entities and Relationships:**

1. **Agreements and Participants:**
   - The `participants` table stores information about companies, including their creditor ID, bank, and department.
   - The `agreements` table represents direct debit agreements, linking to `participants` via `participant_id`. It includes fields for agreement reference, scheme, start/end dates, credit and transaction limits, and metadata such as version, alias, and modification details.
   - The `agreement_accounts` table links accounts to agreements, storing IBAN, BIC, holder name, and other account details.

2. **Batch Processing:**
   - The `agreement_batches` table tracks batches of transactions associated with agreements. It records batch IDs, execution dates, amounts, validation status, and references to approval and batch reasons.
   - The `batch_status_history` table logs status changes for batches, supporting audit and traceability.

3. **Validation and Events:**
   - The `batch_validation_events` table records validation attempts, errors, and posting times for batch processing.
   - The schema supports event-driven validation, as described in the business documentation, with tables for error logs and batch reasons.

4. **NL-Gov Specific Tables:**
   - The `nl_gov_batch_transactions` table stores transactions for NL-Gov batches, including mandate IDs, sequence numbers, amounts, IBANs, and rejection reasons.
   - The `nl_gov_batch_pex_rejected_txns_unprocessed` table tracks unprocessed rejected transactions for NL-Gov batches.

5. **History and Audit:**
   - The `agreements_history` and `agreement_accounts_history` tables maintain historical records of agreements and accounts, supporting audit requirements and tracking changes over time.

6. **Approval and Batch Reasons:**
   - The `approval_reasons` and `batch_reasons` tables define codes and descriptions for reasons related to batch approval and rejection, supporting business logic for validation and exception handling.

7. **PEX Contracts:**
   - The schema includes tables for differential, processed, and unprocessed PEX contracts (`pex_contracts_differential`, `pex_contracts_processed`, `pex_contracts_unprocessed`). These tables store contract data, including participant, agreement, account, and status information. The unprocessed table uses a computed column for a SHA2-512 checksum to ensure data integrity and uniqueness.

8. **Cancelled Batches:**
   - The `cancelled_batches_file_metadata` and `cancelled_batches_unprocessed` tables manage metadata and details for cancelled batches, supporting reconciliation and reporting.

**Indexes and Constraints:**
- The schema defines primary keys, foreign keys, and unique constraints to enforce data integrity.
- Several indexes are created to optimize queries, especially for batch processing and transaction validation.

**Design Considerations:**
- The schema supports complex business validations, such as transaction and credit limits, IBAN uniqueness, and agreement lifecycle management.
- It is structured to handle both B2B/Core and NL-Gov specific requirements, with extensibility for future enhancements.
- Auditability and traceability are emphasized through history tables and status tracking.
